# Automatic-image-Co-Segmentation-using-geometric-mean-saliency-Top-10-paper-award-ICIP-14-
An image co-segmentation algorithm that was presented in ICIP'14. It has been recipient of Top 10% paper award as well. 

Following are the instructions for running the code:

Run compile.m [NOTE: Pls comment line 5 of project.h in mexDenseSIFT and SiftFlow folders if you are compiling using visual studio in windows, and uncomment if you are in linux or mac os.] 
Run main.m for demo
Results will be sub-folder named 'segemntation_masks' where images are located.
